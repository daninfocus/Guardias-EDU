This is my Final Project for CFGS de Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataforma, it is a web-app for college profesors/teachers to organize their free time, around absentees, so the absentee's classroom doesn't go unattended, with tasks, notes and schedules.

Here is the live [demo](https://guardias-edu.vercel.app/).

The stack:
<table>
    <tr>
      <td>
          <img width="50" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/react/react-original-wordmark.svg" />
      </td>
      <td>
        <img width="50" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/nextjs/nextjs-original.svg" />
      </td>
      <td>
        <img width="50" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/typescript/typescript-original.svg" />
      </td>
      <td>

      </td>
      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>
</table>


When logged in to the application for the first time, you have to be registered to a college to be able to use the calendar feature.
![College select page](https://github.com/daninfocus/Guardias-EDU/blob/main/readme-images/1.png?raw=true)

You can select your college from the list.
![College dropdown](https://github.com/daninfocus/Guardias-EDU/blob/main/readme-images/2.png?raw=true)

Or create a new one, this will make you the admin for this college.
![Create college](https://github.com/daninfocus/Guardias-EDU/blob/main/readme-images/3.png?raw=true)

In this section you introduce the name of your college and the classes there are, these classes can be edited later.
![College Created before save](https://github.com/daninfocus/Guardias-EDU/blob/main/readme-images/4.png?raw=true)

Now your college has been created and you can start to use the calendar.
![College Created](https://github.com/daninfocus/Guardias-EDU/blob/main/readme-images/5.png?raw=true)

You can create a new event called Guardia this means at a certain hour the teacher that has created the event will not be able to assist to his classroom, so other teachers that have this hour free have to fill in for them.
![Create event](https://github.com/daninfocus/Guardias-EDU/blob/main/readme-images/6.png?raw=true)

You have to choose a date, the hour and the class the teacher will not attend at.
Then you can write the tasks you left for the students. And other important information.
![Create event](https://github.com/daninfocus/Guardias-EDU/blob/main/readme-images/7.png?raw=true)

If a class is not in the list you can create a temporary one.
![Create new class](https://github.com/daninfocus/Guardias-EDU/blob/main/readme-images/11.png?raw=true)

Once created we can see on the calendar the new event:
![Created event](https://github.com/daninfocus/Guardias-EDU/blob/main/readme-images/8.png?raw=true)

You can click on the event and see all the information for it.
![Event info](https://github.com/daninfocus/Guardias-EDU/blob/main/readme-images/9.png?raw=true)

You can edit it, or delete it, as well as the administrator.
![Event info](https://github.com/daninfocus/Guardias-EDU/blob/main/readme-images/14.png?raw=true)

The navigation.
With the hamburger icon in the top right, you can open the navigation drawer.
This has 5 options, the calendar, the list of teachers in the college, the classes, logout button and drop out of the college.
Only the administrator can open the classes, and he can edit the teachers list, a normal user or teacher can only see the calendar and the list of professors with-out the ability to edit them.
![Event info](https://github.com/daninfocus/Guardias-EDU/blob/main/readme-images/10.jpg?raw=true)


The administrator, as said previously, can edit the teachers:
![Teacher edit list](https://github.com/daninfocus/Guardias-EDU/blob/main/readme-images/13.jpg?raw=true)

A normal user will view it like this:
